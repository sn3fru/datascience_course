    "## Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "In a recurrent neural network we store the output activations from one or more of the layers of the network. Often these are hidden later activations. Then, the next time we feed an input example to the network, we include the previously-stored outputs as additional inputs. You can think of the additional inputs as being concatenated to the end of the “normal” inputs to the previous layer. For example, if a hidden layer had 10 regular input nodes and 128 hidden nodes in the layer, then it would actually have 138 total inputs (assuming you are feeding the layer’s outputs into itself à la Elman) rather than into another layer). Of course, the very first time you try to compute the output of the network you’ll need to fill in those extra 128 inputs with 0s or something.\n",

    "Now, even though RNNs are quite powerful, they suffer from  **Vanishing gradient problem ** which hinders them from using long term information, like they are good for storing memory 3-4 instances of past iterations but larger number of instances don't provide good results so we don't just use regular RNNs. Instead, we use a better variation of RNNs: **Long Short Term Networks(LSTM).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Vanishing Gradient problem?\n",
    "Vanishing gradient problem is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network from further training. As one example of the problem cause, traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range (0, 1), and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. This has the effect of multiplying n of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \"front\" layers in an n-layer network, meaning that the gradient (error signal) decreases exponentially with n while the front layers train very slowly.\n",

    "## Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)\n",
    "Long short-term memory (LSTM) units (or blocks) are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for \"remembering\" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word \"memory\" in LSTM. Each of the three gates can be thought of as a \"conventional\" artificial neuron, as in a multi-layer (or feedforward) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. Intuitively, they can be thought as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM; hence the denotation \"gate\". There are connections between these gates and the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression long short-term refers to the fact that LSTM is a model for the short-term memory which can last for a long period of time. An LSTM is well-suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown size and duration between important events. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problem when training traditional RNNs.\n",

    "Here, I will generate a sequence using just initial 60 values instead of using last 60 values for every new prediction. **Due to doubts in various comments about predictions making use of test set values, I have decided to include sequence generation.** The above models make use of test set so it is using last 60 true values for predicting the new value(I will call it a benchmark). This is why the error is so low. Strong models can bring similar results like above models for sequences too but they require more than just data which has previous values. In case of stocks, we need to know the sentiments of the market, the movement of other stocks and a lot more. So, don't expect a remotely accurate plot. The error will be great and the best I can do is generate the trend similar to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use GRU model for predictions. You can try this using LSTMs also. I have modified GRU model above to get the best sequence possible. I have run the model four times and two times I got error of around 8 to 9. The worst case had an error of around 11. Let's see what this iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GRU model in the previous versions is fine too. Just a little tweaking was required to get good sequences. **The main goal of this kernel is to show how to build RNN models. How you predict data and what kind of data you predict is up to you. I can't give you some 100 lines of code where you put the destination of training and test set and get world-class results. That's something you have to do yourself.**"
