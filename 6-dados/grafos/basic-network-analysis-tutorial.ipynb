Are there any 'sensitive' roads on the path of a given taxi which may cause a longer trip time? These and more questions can be addressed by a network analysis. \n",

Finally we will calculate useful features for the competition, like shortest paths and which boroughs it passes.\n",

    "In this and the following sections, we will introduce some basic terminology of graph theory and try to illustrate those on the New York City Street Network or the Manhattan subgraph. \n",
    "We will start by defining the fundamental definition, what is a graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph **G = (V, E)**  consists of a set of **nodes** V ( or vertices, points)  and a set of **edges**  E ( links, lines) which illustrate how the nodes in the network are interacting with each other. Edges can be **directed** or ** undirected**. The number of nodes **N** is often called the **size** of the network and  states the number of objects in the model. In this example nodes are represented by way points in the OSM map from which the graph was generated, e.g., crossings and edges are roads or sub parts of roads between two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node or edge can hold different attributes, e.g., nodes can be assigned to different types like crossings or dead-ends and edges might have a certain numerical attribute like a speed limit. Edges attributes, in the case of numerical attributes, are called weights. An graph with weighted edges is called an **weighted graph**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first measurement for a node in the graph is the so called **degree**, which stands for the number of edges it has to other nodes, denoted by *k*.  One can also might ask what is the average degree in the network? But wait a second... if the degree is the number of edges it has to other nodes, don't we have to distinguish between directed and undirected edges to calculate the degree? Indeed, we need to distiguish between the **In-degree** and the **Out-degree** of a node, simply measuring how many edges are leaving a node and how many edges are coming in. This of cource depends on if the graph is direted or not. In the case of an undirected graph we can calculate the **average degree** by the following formular:"

    "\n",
    "Why is this so? Because our Network is the Manhattan Street Network and one property of it is that it contains one-way streets which can only be modeled as directed edges.

To mention here is that just like for the degree, some graph porperties are defined on either directed or undirected some can be translated to both, so in order to calculate some measurements we provide also an undirected graph for the Manhattan network simply by calling the build in graph function from networkx.

First of all, deleting nodes which play an important role in the network leads to a faster shrinkage of the giant component than just deleting nodes by random! But only at a given percentage level! At the beginning it doesn't matter if the nodes are picked at random or by their importance, this indicates the robustness of the network. However, at a point there about 10 percent of the nodes are removed deleting specific important nodes lead to a much faster reduction in the giants component size. So these nodes must play an important role in combining the nodes of the network!\n",

Well, there is no 'one' or 'right' defintion of community, because it really depends on the kind of graph you want to analyse and what question you want to answer. A common definition based on the graphs structure is, that a community is a group of nodes which are higly connected within this group, but are less connected to other nodes which are not in this group. But as said this is not the only definition you can use, sometimes you can define communities based on a given node attribute or a combination of both, graph based and attributes. \n",
